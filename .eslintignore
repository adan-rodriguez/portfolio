# In addition to any patterns in the .eslintignore file, ESLint always follows a couple of implicit ignore rules even if the --no-ignore flag is passed. The implicit rules are as follows:

#     - node_modules/ is ignored.
#     - dot-files (except for .eslintrc.*) as well as dot-folders and their contents are ignored.

/build/**
/coverage/**
# !.eslintrc.js
# *.test.js
